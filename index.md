[Project 1 - B9Lab Ethereum Developer Certificate Project](https://github.com/gimercervera/Certificate)
<br><br>
In 2012 I was certified as a Ethereum Developer. This is my final project. It describes a road system controlled by booths and operators. The smart contracts keep track of the vehicles and the payments.
